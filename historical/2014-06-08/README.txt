Hello!

This directory contains the key legends for the Keyboardio keycaps being created by Strongd.

The file master-key-legends-2014-06-08-v2.ai contains the key legends 
which should be engraved on the keys.

Each legend should be oriented so that it is printed straight on the key.
The "main" horizontally and vertically legend should be centered on the key top. 

Some keys have "extra" legends: U I O P H J K L / -
The extra legends should not be used when centering the keys: {}[]←↑↓→\|
The extra legends should be in the upper right corner of the keys they're on. While not precisely placed, the file rough-extra-legend-positions.pngshould help explain what we mean here

The file key-angles-v2.ai should show which keys have which legends on them.
In specific, there are four keys with no legend engraved into them:
r1c1, r1c7, r1c8 and r1c14.

All text has been converted into curves, so there should be no need
for the enclosed font file, gotham-rounded-medium.otf
